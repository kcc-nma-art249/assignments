## Purpose/Objective
- To experiment visually by taking risks.
- To analyze basic information structures and demonstrate the ability to organize ideas into comprehensive information hierarchies.
- To apply the visual elements of line, shape, value, color, texture, time, and the design principles of balance, rhythm, emphasis, contrast, variation, repetition, and unity to interface design assignments.
- To defend the conceptual merits of your own designs.


## Where to start?
### Mood Board
A mood board is a type of collage consisting of images, text, and samples of objects in a composition. A mood board helps establish the branding, design components, typography, imagery, and color palettes that will be incorporated in the design. It sets the aesthetic direction of the site up front without negatively impacting the flow or structure of the site.

What type face works for your client. See different type comabinations and what web font families work well together.

### Grid System
There are multiple grid systems out there (12 column, 16 column, etc) with a range of features (responsive, fixed, and percentage widths, nesting capabilities). Define a grid or use a grid template.
