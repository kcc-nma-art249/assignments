# Week 2 - Conceptual Plans
### A Plan For Success
Conceptual plans are the blueprints for any design project. Conducted early in the design process, they can include any number of documents and exercises that will be helpful in communicating ideas to all stakeholders and instrumental in insuring a quality end product and user experience. The primary goal is to map out the project using a user-centered approach. Planning documents should try to be style/design independent, with a focus on the user's experience, goals, & tasks to help determine the best possible site structure and content hierarchy.


## Purpose of site map and wireframes
- Map out the site architecture, structure, navigation, page hierarchy
- Categorize the site content into logical groups, which will have meaning for the user
- Organize the order of the pages of the site, to create logical paths
- Easy to understand diagrams, useful tool for communicating how the website works
- Keep your client focus
- Avoid gaps
- Visualize what you need. Images, content, etc.


## Site Map
A site map is a list or diagram which represents the hierarchy & structure of the html pages in a website. It lets you take a closer look at the pages in your site and how they lead into each other.
