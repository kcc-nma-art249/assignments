# Week 11 - Development Phase
Now that we're done with our final designs, we're ready to begin coding! Based upon the feedback from your final (midterm) round of comps, transform your visual designs into their final format: a coded web site.


## Git Tagging
Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important. We will use this functionality to mark our Site Draft #1 (ie. v0.1) release point.

1. Navigate to your repository and click the Releases header item

## Exporting in Sketch
In Sketch, to export elements or folders, you select the element or the folder then click on `Make Exportable` on the bottom right corner. You should see an export panel that looks something like:

From here you can either export the slice now or continue slicing up your images/icons and export them all together when you're done.

To export all the slices, click on the `Export` botton on the top right corner. A panel should pop up, where you'll be able to select which slices you want to export.

Sketch also makes it easy to export in different sizes. You can click the little + icon to add another export size. By default this will export at double-size with an @2x suffix, but you can change all of that to whatever you want.
