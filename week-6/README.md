# Week 6 - Designs
## Assignment
Based upon the feedback from your 1st round, make informed design changes to your visual layouts. Revise your themes by omitting those that are not working and expanding upon those that are working. Revise the names of each theme to clarify the visual direction of your designs. Be honest with yourself and true to your client: if nothing is working, then start from scratch with a complete new set of designs for round 2. If certain elements are working conceptually, but not visually, then redesign them in such a way that communicates a strong aesthetic and level of completeness. Pay attention to the details of your design.

Once you have a complete/finished home page, then begin designing your sub pages for each theme.
You must design at least one sub page. Consider designing a “template” sub page layout that will work
for all sub pages.


### Deliverables
The deliverables for Round 2 designs are due on Tuesday, October 06. You
should have your home page & sub page comps saved out as jpegs/png, and uploaded to
your Art 249 website & InVision (see below on how to share your InVision link).
Your home page should have a hotspot to go to your sub page.

Your art 249 website should have the following links:
