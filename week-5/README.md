# Week 5 - Round 1 Designs
## Assignment
Based upon the feedback from your 1st round, make informed design changes to your visual layouts. Revise your themes by omitting those that are not working and expanding upon those that are working. Revise the names of each theme to clarify the visual direction of your designs. Be honest with yourself and true to your client: if nothing is working, then start from scratch with a complete new set of designs for round 2. If certain elements are working conceptually, but not visually, then redesign them in such a way that communicates a strong aesthetic and level of completeness. Pay attention to the details of your design.

Be sure to continue working three thematic directions:

Once you have a complete/finished home page, then begin designing your sub pages for each theme. You must design at least one sub page. Consider designing a “template” sub page layout that will work for all sub pages


## Purpose/Objective
- To experiment visually by taking risks.
- To analyze basic information structures and demonstrate the ability to organize ideas into comprehensive information hierarchies.
- To apply the visual elements of line, shape, value, color, texture, time, and the design principles of balance, rhythm, emphasis, contrast, variation, repetition, and unity to interface design assignments.
- To defend the conceptual merits of your own designs.


## Homework:
- Revise and enhance your designs.
- Continue to work in three different thematic design directions.
- Begin designing your sub pages.
- **Home page and sub page comps** – Due: Tuesday, October 06, 2015
